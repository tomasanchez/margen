/**
 * Per-transaction FX-snapshot capture on create (ADR-148/149/151).
 *
 * Every transaction created going forward carries an FX snapshot so its USD
 * equivalent (`usd_amount`) materializes server-side and budgets can sum it
 * directly (ADR-152) without ever re-deriving USD at a later, drifted rate.
 *
 * FX stays strictly CLIENT-SIDE (ADR-149): the client supplies `fxRate`
 * (ARS per 1 USD, Decimal string) + `fxSource` (provenance); the backend only
 * does the `amount ÷ rate` arithmetic. The rate comes from the persisted
 * preferred source (ADR-151), fetched at the day's CURRENT rate for a manual
 * add.
 *
 * Two paths:
 *
 *  - USD-account rows (ADR-029) already carry `usd` + `rate` (ARS per USD) from
 *    the suggest-confirm flow (ADR-044/045). We REUSE that rate as the snapshot
 *    `fxRate` and tag `fxSource` from the chosen `fxRateType`, so the snapshot is
 *    consistent with the entry the user confirmed — no second fetch.
 *  - ARS rows have no USD figure; we fetch the day's CURRENT preferred-source
 *    rate and stamp `fxRate` + `fxSource` so `usd_amount` still materializes.
 *
 * Never blocks the create: if the current rate can't be fetched (network /
 * unavailable), the input is returned UNCHANGED — the row is created without a
 * snapshot and is picked up later by the historical backfill (ADR-150),
 * surfaced as an "unconverted" note (ADR-152). We never guess a rate.
